            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HAM(Hetzner Android Make) was a long time dream of a project for me to be honest, I'm super lazy and
implement only a dozen of my ideas which annoys me a lot on a personal level. One of such project is
HAM and it feels good to finally release it out in the public.</p><p>Thanks for showing interest in this project, I hope it will grow in the future, even if it does not,
I really like this tool and will continue to support it in the future, at least for my use case.</p><p>This blog will be used to post custom device recipe or instructions for using HAM, I invite anyone
to write on this blog on how they used ham to build LineageOS or AOSP for their device. Maybe git urls
to use with ham to get that specific build. Anything related Android ROM building with HAM.</p><p>Thank you for your Time. If you like this project, please leave a Star at Github, This really helps to
increase the trust on this project.</p><p>Yours,<br>
