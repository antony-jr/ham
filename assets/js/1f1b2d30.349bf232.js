post](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/guide-re-locking-the-bootloader-on-the-oneplus-6t-with-a-self-signed-build-of-los.4113743/), so credits goes to the\\nOP, LineageOS developers and AOSP.**\\n\\n:::\\n\\n\\n## Scope of this Guide\\n\\nCreating an *unofficial build of LineageOS 19.1* suitable for using to re-lock the bootloader on a OnePlus 6 and\\ntake you through the process of re-locking your bootloader after installing the above.\\n\\n## Out of Scope\\n\\nRemove *all* warning messages during boot (the yellow \\"Custom OS\\" message will be present though the orange \\n\\"Unlocked bootloader\\" message will not) allow you to use official builds of LineageOS 19.1 on your device with a \\nre-locked bootloader (more details near the end of the tutorial)\\n\\n## Pre-requisites\\n\\n* Basic knowledge of Terminal commands and features in your OS (Windows, Linux or MacOS)\\n* A OnePlus 6 Device\\n* A PC/Phone which supports you to run **[ham tool](https://antony-jr.github.io/ham/)**\\n* Finished **[setting up ham](https://antony-jr.github.io/ham/docs/get_started)** with \\"Getting Started\\" guide.\\n* A working USB cable\\n* Fastboot/Adb installed and functional\\n* **AndroidCerts.zip**, **Github API Key**, **Github Username** and **Github Repo** from \\"Getting Started\\" [guide](https://antony-jr.github.io/ham/docs/get_started)\\n \\n:::danger\\n\\nThis process may brick your device. Do not proceed unless you are comfortable taking this risk. \\n\\nThis process will delete all data on your phone! Do not proceed unless you have backed up your data!\\n\\nMake sure you have read through this entire process at least once before attempting, if you are uncomfortable \\nwith any steps include in this guide, do not continue.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n**If you did not read the \\"Getting Started\\", please go and \\n[read that first](https://antony-jr.github.io/ham/docs/get_started), \\nthen come back here.**\\n\\n\\n## Preparing ```answers.json```\\n\\nWe can pass a json file to HAM instead of answering everything during the prompt, you can **also** write these answers\\nduring the prompt itself, that\'s your choice.\\n\\nThis file contains **important variables** that are needed from the user (i.e you), like a Github Repo to Upload the\\noutput of the build, a Github API Key to authenticate to upload assets to the given Github repo. A Github Username and\\nPath to the AndroidCerts.zip file.\\n\\nFrom \\"Getting Started\\" guide, you should have all these variables, if you already have **Android Certificates** then\\nzip all the certificates together, that\'s your AndroidCerts.zip file."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/ham/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2022-12-14-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-14-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome to HAM Blogs","description":"HAM(Hetzner Android Make) was a long time dream of a project for me to be honest, I\'m super lazy and","date":"2022-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 14, 2022","tags":[{"label":"hello","permalink":"/ham/blog/tags/hello"},{"label":"welcome","permalink":"/ham/blog/tags/welcome"},{"label":"howdy","permalink":"/ham/blog/tags/howdy"}],"readingTime":0.89,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Divya Antony J.R","title":"Maintainer of HAM","url":"https://antonyjr.in","imageURL":"https://github.com/antony-jr.png","key":"antonyjr"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome to HAM Blogs","authors":["antonyjr"],"tags":["hello","welcome","howdy"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Relocking your Bootloader with LineageOS 19.1 with MindTheGapps on OnePlus 6","permalink":"/ham/blog/enchilada-los19-guide-relocking"}},"content":"HAM(Hetzner Android Make) was a long time dream of a project for me to be honest, I\'m super lazy and \\nimplement only a dozen of my ideas which annoys me a lot on a personal level.

Maybe git urls\\nto use with ham to get that specific build. Anything related Android ROM building with HAM.\\n\\nThank you for your Time.
